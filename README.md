# Completely Fair Scheduler
[Completely Fair Scheduler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Completely_Fair_Scheduler) (CFS) is a CPU scheduling algorithm that was merged to the Linux operating system in 2007. In this project, we created our implementation of CFS algorihm as a simulation, and did some experiments on it to evaluate its performance in certain situations.
